# Rev Project 1

This project automates the testing of the Bugcatcher website provided by Revature. It also contains the RTM, test cases, and defect report. 


## Usage


Execute the runner file to run the tests. Each feature file has a tag which you can include in the cucumber options to only run a particular test.
